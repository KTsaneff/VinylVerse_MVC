## Adding a Theme from Bootswatch.com

To enhance the user interface of our application, we've decided to integrate a theme from Bootswatch.com. Bootswatch offers a variety of themes built on top of Bootstrap, which allows us to quickly style our application with a professional look and feel.

### Steps to Add the Theme

1. **Choose a Theme**: Visit [Bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/) and browse through the available themes. Select the one that best fits the design and aesthetics of our application.

2. **Download the Theme**: Once you've chosen a theme, download the corresponding CSS file from Bootswatch. This CSS file contains all the styles needed to apply the theme to our application.

3. **Include the CSS File**: In your .NET MVC project, add the downloaded CSS file to the appropriate location. Typically, this would be in the `Content` folder within your project.

4. **Reference the CSS File**: Make sure to reference the CSS file in your layout or view files. You can do this by including a `<link>` tag pointing to the CSS file in your HTML layout file (e.g., `_Layout.cshtml`).

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bootswatch-theme.css">
    ```

5. **Verify Integration**: Run your application and verify that the theme is applied correctly across the various pages. Ensure that all elements styled by the theme align with our design requirements.

### Example

Here's an example of how you can include the theme in your `_Layout.cshtml` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My MVC Web API Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/Content/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/Content/bootswatch-theme.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your application content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Acknowledgements

This project utilizes icons from [icons.getbootstrap.com](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), a collection of free icons provided by Bootstrap.
